            A Little Bit About Me
          </div>
          I originally got into coding when I was working in a geology labratory crushing rocks and processing the data with
          Matlab and Python. What started was me messing around with some script files eventually turned into me developing a new passion. Since those days in the lab
          I have spent all my time learning algorithms, creating full stack applications, and optimizing backends.
